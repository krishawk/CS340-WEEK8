# CS340-WEEK8


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable code helps the user navigate easier, and understand the program functionality more smoothly. The CRUD module in this project helps connect with the database that your using so that any information is easy to put in or remove. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I would definently add more time to this project. Some projects need more time put into them, projects that have never been done before by someone needs extra research. In real world situations you are on a time crunch so I understand. Using these databases are helpful for client interface and use. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

We design and analyze hardware systems that solve problems. This matters because this helps businesses/companies better run their services and keep up with daily task or information. 
Using this application for Grazioso Salvare helps them keep track of all the dogs that are good for specific rescue needs and training. everhything is in one place and in one database system so that it is easy to read and find for the future.
